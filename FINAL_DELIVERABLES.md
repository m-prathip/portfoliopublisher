# Final Deliverables — Index

This portfolio publisher was rebuilt in batches against the 17-phase brief.
Everything compiles and is tested (backend flow tests + clean `vite build`).

| `AUDIT_REPORT.md` | Phase 1 — full software audit + roadmap |
| `BATCH_A_CHANGES.md` | Phases 3, 4, 15 — auth, OTP, forgot-password, security |
| `THEME_SYSTEM.md` | Phase 7 — 10-theme engine |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Folder structure, DB schema, **auth/OTP/chatbot flow diagrams** |
| `docs/API.md` | Full API reference |
| `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | Docker + managed deploy, CI/CD, email setup |

## Run it
```bash
# Local (two terminals)
cd backend  && npm install && cp .env.example .env && npm run dev
cd frontend && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run dev

# or everything via Docker
docker compose up --build      # → https://portfoliopublisher.vercel.app
```

## Test it
```bash
cd backend && npm test         # auth flow + API (analytics/contact/assistant) on in-memory Mongo
cd frontend && npm run build    # production build
```

## Notes
- **No SMTP / no OpenAI key required** to run: emails/OTP print to the server
  console and the AI assistant uses a built-in offline mode.
- Frontend installs use `--legacy-peer-deps` because @react-three/fiber is
  pinned to the React-18-compatible v8.
